### About

I didn't had any solid reason to built it, but the work is based on the blog I wrote around four years ago. You can read it [here](https://rishi.ml/2018/smoking/).

The initial and the only goal was to calculate the amount of time I've spent smoking cigarettes, but I added a few more sections which calculates the money that's been spent, total numbers of cigarettes throughout the smoking period etc.

I don't know what's the use of this project for others, but hopefully it could be of some use.

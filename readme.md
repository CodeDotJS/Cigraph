__*Days of Smoke*__ - [Preview](https://cigraph.vercel.app/)

### Why

I didn't have any solid reasons to build it, but the work is a by-product of the blog post I wrote four years ago. You can read it here.

### And

__*Cigraph* is a simple tool that calculates -__

- The total number of cigarettes you've smoked throughout your smoking period.
- The time you've consumed smoking cigarettes - in days and hours.
- The total amount of money you've spent.
- The average sum of money you've been spending etc.

The tool is simple, but I built it anyway. The stats made me think.
